# Meesho Data Analysis(Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel) 

## Project Objective 
To analyze Meesho e-commerce order data to track performance metrics such as total orders, revenue, return rates, and order status trends, and to uncover insights into customer behavior, top-selling products, and regional sales performanceâ€”ultimately guiding data-driven decisions to optimize operations and reduce return rates.

## Dataset used 
- <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahilr05/meesho-orders">Dataset</a>

## Questions(KPIs)
- Which month had the highest number of orders, and what might have driven that peak?
- How many delivered orders were returned, and what is the return rate?
- What are the top selling products, and how much revenue did they generate individually?
- Is the revenue concentrated in just a few products or spread across many?
- Which states have the most orders, and are there any emerging regions to target next?
- How do Delivered, Cancelled, and Returned orders compare-and are any of thm unusually high?
- What are the top reasons for returns, and are certain products returned more often?

## Process
- Imported datasets into Python using pandas.
- Verified and cleaned data by handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
- Merged order and return datasets using a common key (e.g., Sub Order Number).
- Calculated key metrics such as total orders, returns, return rate, and total revenue.
- Used matplotlib to visualize trends by month, product performance, and state-wise orders.
- Exported cleaned data to Excel for reporting and dashboard creation.
- Built an interactive Excel dashboard to present insights effectively.
